"One week after installing this over-the-stove, convection microwave, the stainless steel interior began to look spotted. A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside. Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it. He concluded the metal interior's defect, whereupon Sharp said they would replace (but not pay for reinstallation of) the unit. Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140!!! That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online. Sharp's customer service will not compensate. I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this. Live and learn. It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement (said to be on back-order but still available online!!!).  <br />Aside from the interior cosmetic defect, the microwave looks great and works fine."	11/20/2004	20041120	13	1.015970516	1.092361415	0	2	0.665884194		20041120		1	0.665884194

I really miss the old one. This new model seems to be a lot noisier than the old one. I went from 1.5 cubic feet down to 1.1 and it feels like I lost a lot more room than that. The hood light is VERY dim and the replacement bulbs (2) each cost at least $4 a piece if you can find them. Because we had to vent this into the kitchen we had to sent away to Sharp for a charcoal filter that cost $20 (filter plus shipping and handling.) We had planned to vent it to the outside but the vent didn't even come close to matching up the hole from our former range hood. The cooking turntable is white and very had to keep clean. It is only a month old and is very stained already.  <br />I do like to have the cooking area at eye level.  <br />I researched the price for comparable items on the web before buying and Amazon offered the best price as well as free shipping. I am very pleased with Amazon!	12/10/2004	20041210	51	1.062653563	0.895448806	-3	2	-3.892213846		20041210		3	-3.892213846

The microwave had the infamous GE flaking paint interior problem. The cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep. So I bought a can of this paint to see if it would work.<br /><br />To my amazement, it did! Now it wasn't easy, I had to degrease the inside of the oven (TSP), then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid. I used PaintStriper sanding blocks, 60 and 100 grit, the followed up with some 150 grit paper. Then I had to mask the oven opening with masking tape, paper, and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray.<br /><br />Pro - Followed the directions on the can, and sprayed away! It worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later. So about $35 in material has, so far, stopped a very expensive (hundreds of dollars) oven replacement.<br /><br />Cons - The paint is acetone based so ventilation is a MUST .  Pick a day when doors and windows can be open and I would get the kids out of the house. The paint does dry very fast in about an hour."	4/24/2011	20110424	128	1.157248157	-0.197222222	0	2	-0.136941032		20110424		5	-0.136941032

There isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel, and since it looks like it could possibly be removed, I called Whirlpool customer service to get some clarification.

(I should have done THIS in the first place and never bothered with Whirlpool).<br /><br />I just ordered my SECOND unit from Amazon --- I'm hoping this one will last longer than 28 days.<br /><br />I would give the unit 5 stars if it had not failed --- now only 3.

"I got this microwave yesterday and I've been smiling about it ever since. I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath."	7/3/2013	20130703	110	1.135135135	0.800710109	5	2	8.491294451		20130703	1	5	8.491294451

Found out this is the exact same appliance as the Dacor, at half the price. So we ordered this one, but returned it immediately because it  had dents, so obviously had been dropped, and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old Dacor when operating and I was afraid it had internal damage. Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return. I then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system (vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product), a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying. The microwave I bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one, but I don't know how important an extra 250 watts really is. 850 watts was just fine for us for  10 years.  Could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long? And the convection oven utility is something we may miss more than we now think we will.<br />Anyway I think this is a pretty good product, particularly if you use the convection function a lot. One word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside, remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line. Our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion. The exhaust  then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease, causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron. Also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean. If we had done those things our old Dacor may have lasted who knows how much longer. We considered repairing it but the technician said there was too much grease."	8/10/2013	20130810	6	1.007371007	0.860555556	3.5	1	2.728128582		20130810	9	4	2.728128582

The family is ALWAYS complaining about it:(  Also, for the size of this thing, I thought it would be a tiny bit taller INSIDE. Our freezer makes ice-cream VERY HARD so we 'nuke' it for maybe a minute to get it softer before serving- the round ice-cream container cannot fit upright in it.  Some cups do not fit either.<br /><br />The PLUS side of this tho, is that it DOES fit snugly into a corner! THAT is the only thing that sells it, in my opinion. I have NO IDEA WHY, it is so big & bulky for the size it actually IS, on the inside!? There is a solid 5&#34; of 'bulk' at the bottom, another 3&#34; at the top and about 6 & 3/4&#34; of height INSIDE.... and that does NOT include the plate & roller.... so you TRULY ONLY HAVE a microwave that is 5 & 3/4 INCHES tall inside!! ... The PLATE within, is an 11&#34; plate, but it is very close to the edge. ALSO, the bottom roller that holds the plate in place- is in TWO PARTS, rather than ONE. If this roller gets off the other piece... it makes a rattling noise & makes you think there is something very wrong with it.<br /><br />We only use a microwave for warming things, reheating pizza, a cup of coffee etc., and this does that job very well, however, for $150, I would have absolutely RETURNED IT- had I not lived on an island in Alaska, where the shipping would have KILLED  me :("	10/28/2013	20131028	5	1.006142506	-0.123576605	-0.5	2	-0.778901159		20131028	7	3	-0.778901159

"We needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space. Most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is. It takes up very little room, plus it fits easily into a corner. It has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate. It's tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare, but it is shorter than many standard microwaves. It has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine. We're older and actually really appreciate that simplicity. Some things take longer to cook but not by much.<br />If you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly, this is not the microwave for you. On the other hand, if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy I definitely recommend this one.

Made my 2005 Manufactured GE Spacemaker XL1800 work like new (man! there are a lot of different shells for the XL1800 depending on the year it was made!)! There was a small round diode-like item attached with 2-screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement. Simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick! I also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor...why not? It was there.<br /><br />The whole deal took 2 1/2 hours start to finish - including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor (thanks neighbor!) to get help removing and remounting the microwave.

"We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />Bottom line?

"Look around at microwaves and you will typically see they are all the same rectangular shape. If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet. I cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The inside of this unit is very small. Keep that in mind. It is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space."	7/4/2014	20140704	6	1.007371007	0.427619949	2.25	1	1.715840918		20140704	4	5	1.715840918

This microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far!  We have a GE in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  Be sure to get ALL loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover.  After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat.  I want to make sure it was coated good.  So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  I would take a counter top unit outside to treat.  I didn't have that option so I had to just do it.	7/14/2014	20140714	4	1.004914005	1.264189663	2.48828125	1	2.131476643		20140714	13	5	2.131476643

"I love this new little microwave- I had no room in my small kitchen, but I hardly know it's there, it takes up so little space. The only thing I don't like is, there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table- more parts to worry about should they ever get lost. The plate rests on one of the plastic parts (the turner with wheels) which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom- which makes smaller space to fit tall items. There is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit.<br />The whole unit is easy to clean- ALL, including the inside, is flat and smooth- no dials or protrusions. It has only a 30 second button, so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes- which perfectly heats a cup of coffee. The only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes- I don't know why the manufacturer would choose &#34;popcorn&#34; when coffee/tea is used much more often. This small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily.

If your microwave is like mine, with a turntable, the (factory) paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table.  (NOTE: My oven is at least 10 years old.)  I read the paint can's directions thoroughly, scraping off all the old, loose paint and rust.  The paint says use it in a well-ventilated area; I suggest you wait for a nice, low-humidity day and use the paint outdoors.  (It smells quite bad.)  Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors; I also waited 24 hours before re-installing the turntable and using the microwave.<br /><br />Results:  Within 2 months, the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels, and I'm back where I started before painting.  So -- I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear, this paint will work fine.  Under turntable wheels, not so much.<br /><br />PREVENTION ADVICE:  Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use.  Some foods, such as potatoes, generate a lot of steam/moisture in the oven -- which drained UNDER the turntable.  I didn't always notice the moisture, and that's what caused the rusting in the first place."	12/6/2014	20141206	4	1.004914005	0.448617788	0	1	0.13524669		20141206	49	3	0.13524669

It was  perfect size but stopped working within three months.  After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email, I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to.  I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a three-month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price.  They apologized for the delay, at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system.  Then, after three months of promises, Whirlpool stopped all communication with me. More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my Buy-Back check. I don't expect to get one.  Do not buy this product.  You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon.  In my case, I lost $152.78 and spent many, many hours, time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty.  Whirlpool apparently does not honor it's warranties, at least not for this product.<br /><br />P.S. 10 days after this review was posted, Whirlpool issued a refund check."	12/9/2014	20141209	24	1.029484029	1.208333333	0	1	0.373187961		20141209	56	1	0.373187961

The turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced, and in operation the microwave is very quiet.  One downside of this particular unit is it isn't the most powerful microwave out there - rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range.

In addition, the exterior of the unit becomes *very* hot when using this mode.  I suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often, though it is a nice feature to have.<br /><br />As for the Slim Fry / grilling / combined cooking modes, I have not tried these yet and I'm not sure I will.

It is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used.

In any event, I will take other reviewers word for it that Slim Fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying.

My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling ??which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called oil-less??fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonalds, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and Id still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I dont know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. Its part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else.

"We live out in the country where we are forced to use propane for heat - and we have a gas-powered oven - so we usually don't make pizza at home due to the cost of propane - and most pizzas are too large to fit into our toaster oven. Additionally, when it's hot outside, cooking something in the oven turns our whole house into an inferno - so we live out of the microwave. Being able to cook a frozen pizza and have it be crispy - from the microwave, is so nice. It doesn't seem to ever get to the point where it gets it as crispy as I'd like it - but I do like just about everything burned to a crisp - I'm odd that way.<br /><br />Because of the grill element on the top, there is not as much height clearance as we had in our previous model - but for the vast majority of things we cook, this is not an issue.<br /><br />The stainless steel finish is a nice modern update to our kitchen.

"We live out in the country where we are forced to use propane for heat - and we have a gas-powered oven - so we usually don't make pizza at home due to the cost of propane - and most pizzas are too large to fit into our toaster oven. Additionally, when it's hot outside, cooking something in the oven turns our whole house into an inferno - so we live out of the microwave. Being able to cook a frozen pizza and have it be crispy - from the microwave, is so nice. It doesn't seem to ever get to the point where it gets it as crispy as I'd like it - but I do like just about everything burned to a crisp - I'm odd that way.<br /><br />Because of the grill element on the top, there is not as much height clearance as we had in our previous model - but for the vast majority of things we cook, this is not an issue.<br /><br />The stainless steel finish is a nice modern update to our kitchen.

(The preheat setting is problematic to say the least)	"I picked this unit up primarily for the Convection Oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility. That said, the unit is not without issues.<br /><br />The short story is: the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit. The grill function is great - provided you use the pan that comes with the unit. The convection function is wonderful but never and I mean never use parchment paper in the unit. (FIRE!) The preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off, especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting. The unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built. The two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made.<br /><br />Now for those who are interested, the long story:<br /><br />Microwave:<br /><br />Works just great, seemed to have more power than my built in unit so I did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit. The kids and I have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit.<br /><br />Grill:<br /><br />Love this feature, I made the following - Grilled Cheese (upper rack and pan - 7 minutes with flip at half way point) turned out beautifully. Open face bagel with cheese (upper rack and pan - 5 minutes) grilled to perfection.<br /><br />Convection Oven:<br /><br />I had pretty good but not perfect results here: Baked Russet Potatoes (medium) were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting, my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting. Sweet Potato Fries were kind of a disappointment as well, they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven. Chicken Breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but I did note that Ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result. French bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper - the paper caught fire. I checked the manual about using parchment paper - I use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking - and there was no warning about using it - but I can tell you it is a big no-no.<br /><br />Preheat Function:<br /><br />Well, this function is pretty worthless on my unit. I have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks I have had the unit. The first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire, the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up. The next time we used it, it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down. (It completely turns off, including the time display and will not work at all.) The next time I let it cycle through (both the preheat and 10 minute cycle), the unit remained functional and I was able to convection bake afterwards. Then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook - the unit shut down again. As I said, we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done. Even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey, sometimes the unit remains functional, sometimes it shuts down. The hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use.<br /><br />Slim Fry:<br /><br />We have not tried this function yet but I will update when we do, perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries!<br /><br />Overall, this is a better multifunction machine than I thought it would be. I was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units (toaster oven/convection oven) have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best. The oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side. (Ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs. regular oven on this unit and you should be fine.)  For the price the unit seems a solid investment, my only reservation being the preheat function which I think I will just chose to not use going forward.<br /><br />Recommended with above reservations."	1/16/2015	20150116	5	1.006142506	0.702097039	-0.166666667	2	0.18907922		20150116	42	4	0.18907922

"I've written quite a few product reviews in the past, but never have I seen so much debate and misinformation about what would seem to be a simple kitchen appliance! A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though.

I payed $40 premium for the stainless steel model which was purely for aesthetic reason - my previous microwave was plastic and I did not have any 'material' issue. As for functions, besides the common controls like popcorn,pizza,beverage etc there were a few other controls which I find useful. There is a power level button which lets you step down from full power level to say 50% level. There is also a kitchen timer control which works independently of the cooking control - $5 timer will do that function but having it there help reduce kitchen clutter. There is a two step cooking, which essentially step down the power for the second round - yet to try this feature.<br />Instead of the push button door release a door handle would have made it look more industrial. The wheeled base where the tray rest and the spoke on which tray slots fits looks a bit fragile, probably because of the lack of finish on the molds.<br />Overall this is a very elegant and industrial looking microwave and so far a great addition to my counter top."	1/21/2015	20150121	1	1.001228501	0.297751323	1.75	1.5	1.97391007		20150121	51	4	1.97391007

First I cleaned the microwave thoroughly.  Next I taped off all the areas I did not want painted. I took the microwave outside and placed on a bench. I sanded down all the loose paint and rust with a sanding stone.  I sprayed several thin layers of paint waiting about 15 minutes between coats to let dry. I probably sprayed 20 coats. You could smell the new paint for a couple of days. It has been a couple of months and there has been no chipping.

The grilling feature, (the microwave includes a grill and a setting for accomplishing grilling and the soften/melt feature are nice. I tried the soften/melt feature, for example, and it worked fine. I also think this microwave is attractive so that is not a problem. The only real problem I can see with this microwave is that it is just too large for most countertops. If this is not a problem for you then I recommend this microwave, otherwise, I recommend looking for a smaller microwave."	2/3/2015	20150203	1	1.001228501	1.613553114	2.285714286	1	2.086626211		20150203	78	4	2.086626211

Danby died taking electrical plug with it	"Can someone tell me how to make the door open more easily????????<br /><br />I bought this microwave to sit on top of refrigerator - only place I have for one but the door is so hard to open that by the time I've punched the &#34;open&#34; bar enough to get the thing open, the oven has moved back away from my reach so have to climb on stool and pull it back forward and then put food in.<br /><br /> UPDATE March 6, 2015 -  After buying the nonslip product as suggested by reply to earlier review, the nonslip sits unopened.  Instead, the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator.  For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house, a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones.<br /><br />It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time.  Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box, the Danby managed to screw it up.  After unplugging the Danby and waiting, I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked.  I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave.<br /><br />To use, this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door.  Then adjust turntable so it would turn.  Then add some more time with the 30-second add button.  Then punch it again to open the door.  Meanwhile, from the punching, the oven has slid away from reach so get out the stepstool  Just touching a numbered button DOES NOT begin to set the time.  Instead, that starts &#34;express&#34; time of minutes for the number I touched."	2/5/2015	20150205	1	1.001228501	0.2675	0	1.5	0.120522881		20150205	82	1	0.120522881

Sprayed really nicely, covered well, not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long. Dried quickly, minimum odor, nice sheen looks like new. This was a good fix although I think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but I'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years.

I previously owned a large Panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome, however, after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years, I was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space.  After coming across this one, I was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons: #1 - What if it was actually TOO small? & #2 - It didn't have the crazy power of my last one & I'm impatient.  Alas, I bit the bullet & have been VERY happy with it ever since!  I've realized that I never actually *cook* dishes in the microwave (totally not counting late night Easy Mac liaisons), so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers, making popcorn, heating up water, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last, I still don't feel like I am waiting any longer to get my food hot.  It was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day; now it's no big deal at all.  I usually just press the start button a few times, getting the time up to whatever I want it to be & let it go.  I would highly recommend this microwave for anyone who has similar usage as I, as well as someone who wants to free up some room in a small kitchen."	3/5/2015	20150305	0	1	0.21734871	5	2	7.130409226		20150305	134	5	7.130409226

Then I found a problem after diving into the customer reviews - the overall ratings are good, but for customers who give them low rates have catastrophic failures, e.g. smoking induction ranges, more than other brands.  We decided to stay away from Samsung brand for our major purchases. As we got most of our appliances sorted out, we still need a microwave. This one, again, looked interesting. I thought ok how bad can it be? Its neither too heavy nor too expensive, let's take a risk on this one. But I was wrong.  Long story short, after one month, the turntable starts to make noise. After 3 repair attempts over several weeks, we were left with the turntable not turning at all. To add to the insult, these 3 repair attempts don't even register in Samsung's system, so even if the lemon law is more and more applicable to my case, I would have trouble claiming it.  Based what I found after taking apart of our broken Samsung TV, I think the company put too much emphasis on using their own components, and some of them are not very good. That could be why we are seeing a pattern of reliability problems across its product lines."	3/5/2015	20150305	2	1.002457002	0.407359467	1.75	2	2.701035865		20150305	135	2	2.701035865

The only annoying thing is that start/stop are the same button, but &#34;cancel&#34; is a tiny button near the top of the panel. So often I go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again. I am used to cancel/stop being the same button! I'll reprogram myself. In the meantime, I love it.<br /><br />Side note: There is a cardboard-y thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual - LEAVE IT THERE. If you go to the manufacturer's website, you can find out it's a mica panel to protect a vent.

For example, I bake a large casserole in my oven, keep it in the fridge, then later heat meal-sized portions. This Danby model is perfect for that. Occasionally, I'll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch (or so) interior rotating cooking surface.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, and that is this is a 700 watt microwave. Most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves. This means you must cook things longer with 700 watts. No problem: Do an internet search for &#34;microwave 700 watt conversion chart&#34; and you'll see plenty of charts you can print. I posted one I printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when I need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt Danby. Example: 4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package = 6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave.<br /><br />This is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power. It may no be for everyone. However, it meets my needs exactly. Also, it looks and performs well. I have had no problems with it.

It was purchased to replace an aging micro/convection that I've had for about 8 years. While I've not yet used all the various settings,  I have used the microwave function. More to that in a minute.<br />When I received this item, the box didn't show any damage, but the micro had a sizable dent in the exterior upper back part of one of the side panels. Returning the item seemed like a huge pain (one of the problems with ordering this type of merchandise from an on line source), so I called Amazon customer service and they gave me a credit for the damage.<br />On to the performance of the unit.... It does work well as a microwave, however it is louder than any microwave I've ever had in the past (including the micro/convection that I bought this one to replace.) Is this a problem associated with the dent in the housing? Perhaps.<br />Now, the reason I've only used the micro function? I just haven't had the time to dig thru the manual to figure out how to use the other functions. It really is not very intuitive when it comes to ease of use. Also, while I knew that it had a wheel for time adjustment, I didn't realize how much I'd gotten use to simply entering the time digitally. I know this sounds like a petty complaint, but one would think that as technology advances, we wouldn't be taking backward steps in product design. I'll add more as I have the time to decipher the instructions for more functions."	5/15/2015	20150515	1	1.001228501	0.441666667	2.5	1	1.884812653		20150515	60	3	1.884812653																				0

"Very nice microwave, good size, programming buttons very clear and easy to use. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the door closure.

Really wish there was a way to adjust this-a bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so I don't shove it off the stand to open the door! And one small note...I haven't figured out yet if you can use timer and then go ahead and cook in it without shutting off the timer, my old one you could and find that to be a feature I miss-have written to Danby to ask if I'm missing something on how to do this but they seem to be slow to respond. UPDATE: Danby took over a week to respond but it's as I feared-you cannot set timer and still use microwave to cook-OH WELL but definitely gonna miss that feature from my old microwave. And make sure that when you check a review for Danby microwave, it is for the actual model you are looking at-Amazon has chosen to lump ALL Danby model reviews so whereas this review is for 1.1 and 1000 watt, some reviews are all the way down to the .7 and there seems to be a wide gap in reviews."	7/16/2015	20150716	0	1	0.614801587	4.375	1	3.246940476		20150716	22	4	3.246940476

The settings on the front are easy to use, I regularly use the 30 second option on the &#34;start&#34; button, and it cooks evenly. 1100 Watts is good enough for everything I cook and I like the fact that there is a light when you open the door. I think 5 beeps at the end of cooking is excessive but I do like the fact that there is no reminder beep after 1 minute. Plenty of items need to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes after cooking and a reminder beep is annoying (personal preference though). It is big enough to take a dinner plate but still a nice size for a small kitchen. I like the look of it too - clean lines! I knocked a star off because the door button needs a lot of pressure to open and the microwave slides away from me unless I hold it with the other hand.

Updating my review to 4 stars, won't do five only because of that gap."	8/19/2015	20150819	41	1.05036855	0.614583333	1.964285714	1	1.637918458		20150819	86	4	1.637918458

My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume.
